# First Python Project - Introductory Mini Project

This is my first contact with Python, developed as part of an individual mini-project during the beginning of my college studies in 2023. The purpose of this project is to practice and reinforce basic programming concepts using Python.

## Objective

The project serves as an introductory exercise to familiarize myself with Python syntax and basic programming structures such as:

- **Input and output**: Collecting user input and displaying information.
- **Conditional statements**: Using `if` statements to handle different user choices.
- **Basic arithmetic operations**: Performing addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

## Project Overview

In this mini-project, the program:

1. **Collects basic user information**: 
   - Name, age, and phone number.
   
2. **Offers a simple calculator**: 
   - The user can choose whether or not to use the calculator.
   - Available operations include:
     - Addition (+)
     - Subtraction (-)
     - Division (/)
     - Multiplication (*)
     - Exponentiation (**)

3. **Performs the selected operation**:
   - Depending on the user's choice, the program requests numerical inputs and displays the calculated result.

## Key Learning Points

- Understanding how to take user input and output formatted information.
- Familiarity with basic control flow using `if-else` statements.
- Practicing mathematical operations in Python.
- Handling simple user interactions.

## Conclusion

This project was a useful first step in my programming journey, allowing me to practice fundamental concepts in a hands-on way. It provided a good foundation for more complex topics as I continue to learn and grow as a Python developer.
